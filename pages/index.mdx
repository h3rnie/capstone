## The Place for Singaporean Students

&emsp;&emsp;In Singapore, all children are mandated to attend at least 10 years of schooling, between ages 7 and 16, during their formative years, to attain an education and to acquire knowledge, hence allowing them to explore their interests, secure a job and earn a living. However, due to the nature of our society and structural flaws in the Singaporean education system, students face much school-related stress. This is caused by many reasons, such as stress arising from academic expectations from self or parents, stressful disruptive family events such as divorce, and bullying. In this report, our main focus will be on academic stressors.

&emsp;&emsp;Academic stress is the body&apos;s response to academic-related demands that exceed their adaptive capabilities. Students lack the required knowledge on how to destress in a proper, safe manner, often resulting in students dealing with stress in dangerous and unhelpful ways, going so far as self harm and even suicide. Therefore, students may be more prone to develop mental health issues, such as depression or suicidal ideation, leading to negative impacts inclusive of unproductivity, self harm, insomnia, malnutrition. A vicious cycle of failure and depression may easily arise. Suicides and mental distress are common features among youth who succumb to stress, the rates of which have exponentially risen over the years. According to the Samaritans of Singapore, 71 youths, aged 10 to 29, have committed suicide in 2019. This correlates with the age range that covers periods of education where academic stress builds up gradually, which may be accounted for due to the presence of the PSLE, O-Levels, A-Levels and other major examinations which influence their futures directly or indirectly. Similarly, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) saw an average of 2400 new cases yearly from 2012 to 2017, affirmed by Dr Lim Choon Guan, who started seeing more students in IMH from top schools and experiencing academic stress.

&emsp;&emsp;Academic stress is being severely overlooked. In the River Valley incident that occured in 2021, a 16-year-old student suffering from mental illness, murdered another 13-year-old student. The fact that a teenager under the Singapore education system can face severe mental stress, leading to a murder case emphasises the significance of the issue. This issue could have been solved earlier when the student&apos;s mental condition had not worsened. Unfortunately, it had been overlooked till said incident unfolded. According to a post on The Independent, a teenager from the Singapore education system claimed that “help can be hard to find and Singaporeans generally aren&apos;t very accepting of people with mental illnesses”, and IMH&apos;s psychiatrists were extremely overworked since the wards are always near to full capacity. This shows that mental illnesses arising from academic stress are seemingly more frequent over the years but at the same time, overlooked by the government. As a result, there is an urgency to deal with the issue, since many impacts (discussed in the next section) can potentially arise and threaten all of us.
