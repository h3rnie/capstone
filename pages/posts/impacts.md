&emsp;&emsp;Relevant stakeholders and their associated issues include (i) mental stress on students, (ii) stress on families worrying for youths and soured relationships, (iii) Singapore’s society losing out and being unstable.

&emsp;&emsp;This issue would directly impact students who are in this vigorous and unforgiving education system, where stress is an everyday occurrence. Students are the immediate recipients of stress in education. This group of people are still growing and maturing, and hence do not have an optimal foundation for their mental health and psychological well-being. As a result, a variety of negative effects can waver their mental health, causing issues such as mental breakdowns. Lack of motivation in both academics and life will not only cause precious time of their youth to go to waste, but more importantly, also impacts students’ bodies. Suicidal ideation, self harm are extreme activities whom students carry out when they feel too overwhelmed and can no longer cope with the pressure building up from various aspects. On other occasions, depression may occur, where students have a hopeless outlook which interferes with their daily lives. The lack of happiness not only causes increased fatigue, insomnia, weight loss and mood swings. As a result of their still-developing minds, they are more likely to choose to run away from reality when they are subjected to a fight or flight situation. Individuals experiencing high levels of stress to engage in unhealthy behaviours (Hudd et al., 2000). For instance, it leads to excessive alcohol consumption (Morgan, 1977), smoking (Naquin et al., 1996) and reduction in the functioning of the immune system (Sarid et al., 2004), and worse of all, increased tendency of suicidal thoughts (Hirsch et al., 1996).

&emsp;&emsp;Immediate families, i.e. parents and siblings, of the students are also affected. Not only do they have to carry out their usual nine-to-five jobs, perform household chores, their children who are dealing with such issues mentioned above will increase workload for them. Extreme concern, fatigue and anger arising from constant caring and guiding their children can make them experience burnout, which is a state of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. Coupled with high stress, families may observe a change in attitude to an easily irritable one, and cause immediate family members to fall ill. At the same time, the integrity of the family relationships may also be threatened, risking the family falling apart. Guilt from their children’s unexpected change or death can also cause the family to experience hopelessness, losing complete motivation to continue on with their daily activities. A survey by the Singapore Management University (SMU) with the support of Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL), Enable Asia and the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), reveals that caregivers of persons with mental health issues including dementia: 75% expressed a need for temporary separation from the person they care for and more than 72% also said caring for the person with mental health issues makes them tired and exhausted.

&emsp;&emsp;Our nation’s society as a whole is also affected. Mental illnesses can be considered a ‘long-term sickness’, which treatment will be costly, thus draining manpower and resources. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) research carried out in 2008, mental health accounts for 38% of all illnesses in the richer countries. It also found that it reduced the United Kingdom’s gross domestic product (GDP) of 2009 to 2010 by almost 7%, which is a huge sum that could have been utilised to help further develop the country. Increasing numbers of teenagers are facing academic stress and strain on their mental health, which may continue even when they are employed in the workforce. Therefore, it poses a threat to the socioeconomic development and civil progression of our society, reducing our country’s viability as a business hub for multinational companies and investors on the global stage, decreasing Singapore’s economic competitiveness in the long run.
