## Take a deep breath! Which of the following do you associate with the most?

- You’re literally the busiest person you know.
- Like sooooo busy.
- So busy that you didn’t have time to shower this morning.
- You have inexplicably sweaty palms.
- Your relationship with your parents is on the rocks.
- So is your relationship with the rest of your family.
- Hell! Your relationship with everyone is on the rocks.
- Are you sick?
- Do you think you’re sick?
- YOU DEFINITELY DON’T HAVE TIME TO GET SICK RIGHT NOW.
- Are you currently working under a deadline?
- Did you already miss it?
- Is this quiz stressing you out?
- Do you feel there are literally not enough hours in the day to get your work done?
- Getting ready takes you forever.
- You’re never really sure if you turned the stove off before you left.
- Or left the phone off the hook.
- Or locked the door.
- Or turned off the AC.
- You just can’t handle super-dramatic TV shows like "Breaking Bad."
- Because your life is already like SOO dramatic! Right?
- You CANNOT deal with people who are bad at making plans.
- You like to be in control.
- But no matter how much control you have, things always seem to get OUT of control.
- And then suddenly YOU’RE out of control.
- And don’t even get you started on flakes!
- Is this quiz still stressing you out?
- Do you need a break?
- You think techno music is the absolute worst.
- And you — no lie — have zero time for dubstep.
- You have trouble sleeping.
- And you sometimes inexplicably wake up in a cold sweat.
- You can’t remember the last time you took a vacation.
- It’s been so long that you don’t even know what vacation means anymore.
- You mistakenly give out your work address instead of your own because you spend more time there than at home.
- Your social life is hanging by a thread.
- You feel exactly like Andy Sachs in "The Devil Wears Prada."
- Who? You don’t have time for movies. You’re too busy!
- The only “alone” time you get these days is in the bathroom.
- The only thing that makes you feel better is food.
- You’re going to eat your little heart out as soon as you get home.
- Home? No time for that! There’s still work to be done!
