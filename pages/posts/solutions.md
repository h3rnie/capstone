&emsp;&emsp;As parents often place a lot of academic pressure on their children, they are indeed the most apt and suited to help their children overcome academic pressure. Therefore, we suggest that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can create an online platform to aid parents in reducing academic stress for their children. This platform can educate parents about the stresses students face, as they may be unfamiliar with the issues of their children, especially when they face mounting stress and are reluctant to share their stress. Tips and suggestions to provide a stress-free environment for their children can also be shared.

&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, we propose these NGOs to create a community for parents, similar to Parent Support Groups (PSGs) in schools but scaled to a national level, where parents from the entire nation can come to this platform to share their experiences of how they managed to reduce academic stress for their children, or for parents with children suffering from stress to seek help. This platform serves to provide reference for parents and encourages a supportive and foundational environment where children are encouraged rather than forced to achieve their aspirations. With a reduction in parental pressure, students hence face significantly less academic stress and have the freedom to soar. However, there should be moderators and healthcare professionals (especially experts in adolescent development and mental health) so that there is order and reliable information being distributed.

&emsp;&emsp;A study showed that a “vast majority of parents gave general reasons for enrolling, such as a desire for knowledge, understanding, and skills, for promotion (of a positive development for the child and the relationship) and prevention (of a negative development for the child or the relationship). About a fifth of the parents gave problem-oriented reasons, and those reported more negative circumstances for both themselves and their children than parents who gave more general enrollment reasons.” This shows that parents would be willing to join the app, even if they do not face any issues with the upbringing of their child, as it is within the nature of a parent to want the best for their child.

&emsp;&emsp;Limitations would be that it is not required that parents actively contribute to such forums and may not take advice given seriously. There is also the risk of fake news being spread quickly through this support group, which may cause confusion, disrupting the daily lives of both students and parents. There is also the risk of hackers or trollers entering the support group just to cause chaos or to hijack the system.

&emsp;&emsp;In this modern age, students are often spending long hours on their mobile devices, and with the average age Singapore children getting an internet-connected device being 8 years old, an application which can help manage academic stress would be able to help a wide range of students. Hence, we suggest a solution where NGOs can develop an anti-stress app for students to help them cope with academic stress. The app can have features that teach students how to meditate and relax through music or exercise, help them create a schedule which allows time for relaxation and track a student’s sleep cycle. These features can greatly help reduce stress for the students, by helping them to relax, take breaks regularly and ensure that they have ample sleep. A study on the effectiveness of meditation apps on university students showed that 90.9% of the students found such apps effective in reducing stress. Evidently, such an anti-stress app for students would greatly reduce academic stress and relieve pressure.

&emsp;&emsp;A study into creating a “stress-free” mobile app for Moroccan university students suggested that the app would first measure the stress level of users using the Perceived Stress Scale 10, with results indicating if the user faced a normal, low, moderate or high stress level. Afterwards, they would be redirected to the appropriate stress relief programmes/activities. 73.37% of the students enrolled in this study felt that the app would be beneficial or very beneficial. This shows that the students welcomed the app and would use it for stress-relief. This could be adapted to Singapore, where every student would be required to download the app. More in-depth research could be done to find out more about the demographics of the student population in Singapore and edit the methods to determine stress levels to a more suitable one. The app would then teach or guide students on relaxation methods, such as meditation, enjoying music or exercising. We hope that this app can be used nationwide to reduce stress levels amongst students. Students can also be connected via the app, such that they can care for each other in times of need. Machine learning can also be implemented to help improve the app over time, such that it recognises trends in mental health amongst students over time, such that projections can be made with enough data and the education system can change accordingly to accommodate future students.

&emsp;&emsp;Limitations would be that it would take time and effort to conduct a nationwide demographic research into the student population and the causes, impacts and coping mechanisms towards school-related stress. It would take much expert opinion to be able to build the app successfully and maintain it afterwards as well (bugs and glitches). Students may not use the app if it is not implemented in a suitable fashion (privacy concerns, cybersecurity concerns.)
