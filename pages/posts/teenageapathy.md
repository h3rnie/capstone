A high school journalism project asked six good questions about the issue of teenage apathy. What follows are some of my opinions in response, not as a research psychologist but as a counseling practitioner.

“How has social media created apathy in teenagers?"

I don’t think that social media has created apathy, but it has enabled it. Like most technological advances, social media can be a mixed blessing.

To the good, social media has allowed people:
- to participate in a sense of community,
- to communicate in multi-media ways,
- to host a platform for sharing what feels newsworthy,
- to create a gallery for portraying one's personal identity.

To the not so good, social media has allowed people:
- to create the illusion of involvement,
- to experience a sense of overwhelming change,
- to cause an overload of questionable information,
- to lose distinction between passing and permanent importance.

In response to some act of violence or tragedy in the lives of others, our caring can become momentary, quickly passing to pay attention to the next excitement. The onslaught of sensational social media can make it hard for human caring to catch lasting hold.
